# Vulos Office — Screenshots

This document describes the screenshot gallery, how screenshots are captured, and the seed data used to produce populated views.

---

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Install npm dependencies (including Playwright)
npm install

# Install Playwright's Chromium browser
npx playwright install chromium

# Build the frontend (the screenshotter uses the compiled binary + dist/)
npm run build:frontend
```

---

## Capturing screenshots

```bash
npm run screenshots
```

The screenshotter is self-contained — it:
1. Writes demo data files to `/tmp/vulos-demo-data/` (never touches `./data`)
2. Builds the Go binary (which embeds the frontend via `//go:embed`)
3. Starts the binary on port 8083 pointed at the demo data dir
4. Seeds Spaces channels + messages, Calendar events, Contacts, and Meetings via the REST API
5. Captures all surfaces at 1440×900 (dark mode)
6. Stops the server

To capture against a deployed instance:

```bash
BASE_URL=https://office.example.com npm run screenshots
```

To push seed data to an external instance before capturing:

```bash
BASE_URL=https://office.example.com npm run screenshots -- --seed
```

## Seed data

Demo data is committed in `scripts/seed-demo.mjs` and never touches `./data` — it uses a temporary directory at `/tmp/vulos-demo-data`.
