# Vulos Office — Task Backlog

Actionable work for autonomous coding agents, grouped by area and
**priority-ordered**. Vulos Office is the productivity surface of the Vulos
project: Documents / Sheets / Slides / PDF today, growing into a networked office
(real-time collaboration, e-signature, and a chat+meetings pillar) that rides the
**Vulos peer fabric** — the same CRDT-bucket + WebRTC + relay/TURN transport the
OS uses for device routing.

> **Stack invariants (FROZEN):** Go backend (`vulos-office`, Gin); React 18 / Vite
> / Tailwind frontend, **JSX only — NEVER `.tsx`**; MIT license. Collaboration,
> chat, and calling reuse the Vulos fabric (cr-sqlite/CRDT sync to buckets,
> WebRTC P2P, **Vulos relay/TURN fallback** — see vulos-cloud RELAY signaling),
> NOT a bespoke server. Local single-binary mode needs no account and emits no
> telemetry. Frontend embeds into the Go binary; `go build ./... && npm run build`
> is the universal gate.

## How to read a task

```
### [OFFICE-NN] short title
`todo` · P0|P1|P2|P3 · S|M|L · dep: <IDs or none> · parallel: yes|no — owned file path(s)
Scope: one paragraph; enough for an autonomous agent.
AC: [ ] verifiable outcome [ ] … [ ] go build ./... && npm run build (or the stated gate)
```

**Status token** — `` `todo` `` or `` `done` `` on the line after `### [ID]`.
**Priority** — `P0` highest → `P3` lowest. **Effort** — `S`/`M`/`L`.
**`parallel: no`** — touches a hot shared file; rebase on main before PR.
**Picking a task** — any `todo` whose `dep:` entries are all `done` is fair game.

`done` · P2 · L · dep: OFFICE-22, OFFICE-26 · parallel: yes — src/apps/docs/DocsEditor.jsx, src/lib/crdt/suggestions.js, src/components/SuggestionPanel.jsx
Scope: Suggestion mode for Docs: edits are recorded as CRDT-friendly suggestion annotations (insert/delete proposals) rather than direct mutations; a reviewer accepts/rejects each; accepted suggestions fold into the base CRDT. Visual diff styling for pending suggestions. JSX only.
AC: [ ] edits in suggestion mode render as pending, not applied [ ] accept folds into doc, reject discards [ ] suggestions converge across peers [ ] npm run build

### [OFFICE-28] Document activity feed + named snapshots from op-log
`done` · P3 · M · dep: OFFICE-21, OFFICE-08 · parallel: yes — src/lib/crdt/index.js, src/components/HistoryPanel.jsx
Scope: Derive a per-document activity feed and named version snapshots from the CRDT op-log (who changed what, when); allow naming/restoring a snapshot. Reconcile with the local version history from OFFICE-08. JSX only.
AC: [ ] activity feed lists ops with author + time [ ] name + restore a snapshot from the op-log [ ] npm run build

Scope: Generate a unique, scoped, expiring link per signer (`POST /api/sign/:envelopeId/send` → per-signer tokens). Public route `/sign/:token` opens a focused signing view showing only that signer's assigned fields on the rendered PDF; logs `viewed` to the audit trail on open. Enforce signing order (a signer's link is inactive until prior signers complete). JSX only.
AC: [ ] send issues one scoped token per signer [ ] /sign/:token shows only that signer's fields [ ] open logs a viewed audit event [ ] out-of-order signer link → 403/locked [ ] go build ./... && npm run build

Scope: When all signers complete, flatten all signature/field overlays into the PDF (pdf-lib server-side or client export), append a generated completion-certificate page summarizing every signer, token, hash, timestamp, and IP/identity, and attach a machine-readable manifest (JSON) of the audit chain. Expose `GET /api/sign/:envelopeId/download` for the sealed PDF + certificate.
AC: [ ] sealed PDF includes all signatures flattened [ ] certificate page lists signers/tokens/hashes/timestamps [ ] machine-readable manifest attached/available [ ] download endpoint returns sealed PDF [ ] go build ./...

### [OFFICE-47] Signature + audit verification tool
`done` · P2 · M · dep: OFFICE-44, OFFICE-46 · parallel: yes — backend/handlers/signing.go, backend/signing/crypto.go, src/components/VerifyView.jsx
Scope: A verifier (`POST /api/sign/verify` + a `/verify` UI) that, given a sealed PDF (or envelope id), re-hashes the document, validates each signature token against the server public key, re-checks the hash-chained audit log, and reports tamper status per signer + overall. JSX only.
