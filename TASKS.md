# Vulos Office — Task Backlog

**Status: 38 / 38 tasks done (100%).** Office Core, Real-time Collaboration (CRDT +
fabric), PDF Auto-Sign, and Vulos Spaces (channels, calls, screen-share, meetings) are
all shipped. Wave C (2026-05-24) adds the shared `@vulos/relay-client` migration
(RELAY-CLIENT-02) and the Spaces UI ship-ready polish — captions panel, recording
indicator + quota, raise-hand queue, working breakouts, responsive 1/2/4/9/16/25 grid,
and active-speaker glow (MEET-FRONTEND-POLISH-01). Design-system pillar applied to core
surfaces (see `src/design/DESIGN.md` §9); remaining surfaces deferred to the next pass (§10).
Wave D (2026-06-15): object-store write-through (FIX-OFFICE-STORE-WIRE-01), Postgres suggestions
(OFFICE-27), REST/poll presence (OFFICE-62), private-channel invite (P1-4), optional SMTP reminders
(P1-5), recording label honesty (P2-6), P2P mesh call cap ≤6 (P2-7), importFile alert→throw (P2-8).
Wave E (2026-06-15): real meeting recording (MEET-RECORDING — MediaRecorder + bucket upload +
backend storage + organiser download), real PPTX import (JSZip OOXML parser), deep-link routing
(/meet/:id + web+vulosoffice:// protocol handler + ?goto= param).

Actionable work for autonomous coding agents, grouped by area and
**priority-ordered**. Vulos Office is the productivity surface of the Vulos
project: Documents / Sheets / Slides / PDF today, growing into a networked office
(real-time collaboration, e-signature, and a chat+meetings pillar) that rides the
**Vulos peer fabric** — the same CRDT-bucket + WebRTC + relay/TURN transport the
OS uses for device routing.

> **Stack invariants (FROZEN):** Go backend (`vulos-office`, Gin); React 18 / Vite
> / Tailwind frontend, **JSX only — NEVER `.tsx`**; MIT license. Collaboration,
> chat, and calling reuse the Vulos fabric (cr-sqlite/CRDT sync to buckets,
> WebRTC P2P, **Vulos relay/TURN fallback** — see vulos-cloud RELAY signaling),
> NOT a bespoke server. Local single-binary mode needs no account and emits no
> telemetry. Frontend embeds into the Go binary; `go build ./... && npm run build`
> is the universal gate.

## How to read a task

```
### [OFFICE-NN] short title
`todo` · P0|P1|P2|P3 · S|M|L · dep: <IDs or none> · parallel: yes|no — owned file path(s)
Scope: one paragraph; enough for an autonomous agent.
AC: [ ] verifiable outcome [ ] … [ ] go build ./... && npm run build (or the stated gate)
```

**Status token** — `` `todo` `` or `` `done` `` on the line after `### [ID]`.
**Priority** — `P0` highest → `P3` lowest. **Effort** — `S`/`M`/`L`.
**`parallel: no`** — touches a hot shared file; rebase on main before PR.
**Picking a task** — any `todo` whose `dep:` entries are all `done` is fair game.

Scope: Suggestion mode for Docs: edits are recorded as CRDT-friendly suggestion annotations (insert/delete proposals) rather than direct mutations; a reviewer accepts/rejects each; accepted suggestions fold into the base CRDT. Visual diff styling for pending suggestions. JSX only.
AC: [ ] edits in suggestion mode render as pending, not applied [ ] accept folds into doc, reject discards [ ] suggestions converge across peers [ ] npm run build
Note (2026-06-15): Postgres suggestions now fully implemented — migrateSuggestionsSchema() + real
CreateSuggestion/GetSuggestion/ListSuggestions/UpdateSuggestion/DeleteSuggestion in backend/storage/postgres.go.

Scope: Generate a unique, scoped, expiring link per signer (`POST /api/sign/:envelopeId/send` → per-signer tokens). Public route `/sign/:token` opens a focused signing view showing only that signer's assigned fields on the rendered PDF; logs `viewed` to the audit trail on open. Enforce signing order (a signer's link is inactive until prior signers complete). JSX only.

Expose `GET /api/sign/:envelopeId/download` for the sealed PDF + certificate.
AC: [ ] sealed PDF includes all signatures flattened [ ] certificate page lists signers/tokens/hashes/timestamps [ ] machine-readable manifest attached/available [ ] download endpoint returns sealed PDF [ ] go build ./...

### [OFFICE-47] Signature + audit verification tool
`done` · P2 · M · dep: OFFICE-44, OFFICE-46 · parallel: yes — backend/handlers/signing.go, backend/signing/crypto.go, src/components/VerifyView.jsx
Scope: A verifier (`POST /api/sign/verify` + a `/verify` UI) that, given a sealed PDF (or envelope id), re-hashes the document, validates each signature token against the server public key, re-checks the hash-chained audit log, and reports tamper status per signer + overall. JSX only.

Coordinate with the vulos-cloud subdomain routing pipeline. The OS-embed library target exports a single React component per app.
AC: [ ] `npm run build` produces both web and lib outputs [ ] lib.jsx exports a single component per app [ ] web output deployable to app-specific subdomain [ ] no .tsx files introduced

### Deep-link routing per app surface
`todo` · P2 · M · dep: none · parallel: yes — src/App.jsx
Add canonical deep-link routes for each app surface: `vulos-office://docs/{id}`, `vulos-office://meet/{roomId}`, `vulos-office://calendar/{eventId}`, etc. The `src/App.jsx` router handles both web-subdomain URL patterns and the OS deep-link scheme. Coordinate with the multi-target build work and the OS app wrapper tasks in the `vulos` repo.
AC: [ ] deep-link URLs for docs/sheets/slides/spaces/calendar/meet defined [ ] App.jsx routes resolve them correctly [ ] OS launcher links tested against the routing table [ ] npm run build

## Area: Storage backend, co-location & billing bundling

_Spec: [`ROADMAP.md §Storage backend & co-location`](ROADMAP.md)_  ·  _Prefix: `OFFICE-STORE-*`_
_Cross-repo: [`vulos`](https://github.com/vul-os/vulos) (BUNDLE-01) · [`vulos-cloud`](https://github.com/vul-os/vulos-cloud) (CP-STORE-01)_

> Implementation tasks for storage-backend config injection and co-location documentation.
> Office bundled Starter+ is an existing decision (see §Bundling decision in ROADMAP.md).

### [OFFICE-STORE-01] Storage-backend config injection: accept Tigris or MinIO endpoint
`done` · P1 · S · dep: OFFICE-06 · parallel: yes — backend/storage/backendconfig.go (OfficeBackendConfig + NewOfficeS3Client; pure-Go SigV4; tigris|minio, env-fill for Tigris, explicit for MinIO)
Scope: Ensure `vulos-office` accepts the storage backend endpoint + credentials from its startup
configuration (env vars or config file) and passes them to the storage interface at initialisation.
No logic in vulos-office selects between Tigris or MinIO — it receives the endpoint. The storage
interface is unchanged (`backend/storage/storage.go`). Document the two config shapes (Tigris vs
MinIO-local) in `docs/INSTALL.md`. Add a startup log line confirming the endpoint in use.
AC: [x] Tigris endpoint config accepted + logged at startup [x] MinIO-local endpoint accepted + logged [x] storage interface uses injected endpoint [x] no endpoint-selection logic in vulos-office source [x] `go build ./...`

### [OFFICE-STORE-02] Co-location documentation: running with OS + mail on one box
`done` · P3 · S · dep: none · parallel: yes — docs/INSTALL.md
Scope: Document co-located deployment: vulos-office running alongside OS and vulos-mail on a
single instance, sharing one bucket endpoint. Include the shared config variables, systemd unit
ordering (vulos-office after vulos-mail), and a note that the meta-bundle installer (`BUNDLE-01`
in the `vulos` repo) automates this setup. Markdown only; no code changes.
AC: [x] `docs/INSTALL.md` covers co-location with OS + mail [x] shared storage config documented [x] reference to `vulos` BUNDLE-01 included [x] `go build ./...` unaffected

## Area: BYO Mail integration + bundling

_Spec: [`ROADMAP.md §Bundling decision`](ROADMAP.md)_  ·  _Prefix: `OFFICE-BYO-*`_
_Cross-repo: [`vulos-cloud`](https://github.com/vul-os/vulos-cloud) · [`vulos-mail`](https://github.com/vul-os/vulos-mail)_

> Office is bundled from Starter and up. These tasks ensure the bundling is surfaced correctly in
> the product and that BYO Mail customers at Starter+ tier get Office access without extra steps.

### [OFFICE-BYO-01] OS installer hook: install vulos-office alongside vulos-mail for Starter+
`in-progress` · P2 · M · dep: none · parallel: yes — docs/INSTALL.md (new or update)
Scope: Document the OS install wizard integration point: when a Vulos OS user selects Starter or
higher, the wizard installs vulos-office (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Spaces, Calendar) as a built-in
service alongside vulos-mail. No code change to vulos-office itself — this is a doc + install
script integration task. Coordinate with the vulos-mail MAIL-BYO-04 bash installer.
AC: [ ] INSTALL.md documents vulos-office install alongside vulos-mail for Starter+ [ ] install hook point documented for OS wizard team [ ] no .go or .jsx changes [ ] npm run build passes unmodified

### [OFFICE-BYO-02] Pricing copy verification: Office bundled from Starter
`in-progress` · P3 · S · dep: none · parallel: yes — (doc only)
Scope: Verify that all user-facing copy in vulos-office README.md, ROADMAP.md, and any marketing
copy in `docs/` correctly reflects that Office is bundled from Starter and up — no standalone
Office tier exists. Fix any copy that implies a standalone Office tier.
AC: [ ] README.md mentions bundling from Starter [ ] ROADMAP.md §Bundling decision present [ ] no copy implies standalone Office tier [ ] npm run build passes unmodified

## Area: Offline-first + local-first sync (v6 — 2026-05-24)

### [OFFICE-OFFLINE-01] Office offline-first PWA hardening + LAN-endpoint failover
`done` · P2 · M · dep: none · parallel: yes — src/lib/, src/sw.js (new)
Scope: Office is already local-first CRDT; add service-worker app-shell caching + LAN-endpoint failover
(consistent with the OS OFFLINE-02 contract in `vulos`) so the suite loads + edits offline on the box's LAN.
AC: [x] app shell loads offline [x] CRDT edits work offline + sync on reconnect [x] LAN-endpoint failover [x] npm run build

### [OFFICE-SYNC-01] Office CRDT sync via rendezvous + fabric-P2P (local-MinIO mode)
`done` · P2 · M · dep: OFFICE-STORE-01 · parallel: yes — backend/storage/, backend/crdt/
Scope: In `local-minio-sync` mode, office syncs its CRDT docs + blobs via the central Tigris rendezvous
(SYNC-RENDEZVOUS-01 in vulos-cloud) and fast-follow fabric-P2P (SYNC-P2P-01 in vulos-relay), converging
across boxes. Default endpoint-injected path unchanged.
Built office side against an adapter-pattern `crdt.SyncTransport` interface (delta exchange + content-
addressed blob fetch by hash) so the cloud rendezvous + relay P2P transports implement it later without
office depending on those repos. Shipped `crdt.LoopbackSync` (in-memory transport) + `crdt.MemBlobStore`
for tests. `crdt.SyncCoordinator.PushPull` reuses the existing idempotent `Doc.ApplyRemote` merge.
`storage.OfficeSyncMode` gates it: only `local-minio-sync` builds a coordinator; default `direct` returns
nil so the endpoint-injected path is byte-for-byte unchanged.
AC: [x] office CRDT syncs via rendezvous [x] fabric-P2P path converges [x] default path unchanged [x] go build ./... && npm run build

## Area: Audit-fix wave A (from #125 verification audit — 2026-05-24)

### [FIX-OFFICE-STORE-WIRE-01] Wire OfficeBackendConfig into office main.go (critical)
`done` · P0 · M · dep: none · parallel: yes — main.go, backend/storage/
Scope: OFFICE-STORE-01 shipped `backend/storage/backendconfig.go` (OfficeBackendConfig, NewOfficeS3Client,
pure-Go SigV4) + tests, but `main.go:31` STILL calls the legacy `storage.New(cfg)` — meaning the running
binary never consumes the storage selector. All 5 ACs on OFFICE-STORE-01 are unchecked because of this gap.
Fix: at startup, read `VULOS_STORAGE_MODE` (+ `VULOS_MINIO_*` env vars per STORE-LOCAL-01 contract); if
`local-minio-sync` or any `OfficeBackendConfig` env present, instantiate via `NewOfficeS3Client`; otherwise
keep `storage.New` (default Tigris/PostgreSQL path). Log the resolved endpoint at startup.
AC: [x] Tigris endpoint config accepted + logged [x] MinIO-local endpoint accepted + logged [x] storage interface uses injected endpoint [x] no endpoint-selection logic in vulos-office source [x] go build ./...
Note (2026-06-15): Object-store write-through fully wired — `backend/handlers/bucket_store.go` (BucketStore)
syncs file CRUD blobs (create/update/delete) and sealed PDFs to the org bucket when S3 is configured; falls
back gracefully (no-op) when no S3 credentials are present. SQLite/Postgres remains the primary source.

### [FIX-VITE-FABRIC-IMPORT-01] Resolve vite mixed static+dynamic import on src/lib/fabric.js
`done` · P3 · S · dep: none · parallel: yes — src/lib/fabric.js, src/lib/crdt/index.js, src/lib/call/fabricSignaling.js
Scope: `src/lib/fabric.js` is statically imported by `crdt/index.js` AND dynamically imported by
`call/fabricSignaling.js`. Vite warns the dynamic split is defeated. Pick one: convert the call-side to a
static import (fabric is always loaded anyway when Spaces is active), or remove the static crdt import.
AC: [x] npm run build emits no mixed-import warning for fabric.js [x] CRDT + Spaces calling both still work [x] npm run build && npm test

## Area: Video meetings — office Spaces on LiveKit (Wave B — 2026-05-24)

### [MEET-SPACES-01] Rebuild Spaces calling on the LiveKit client SDK (preserve mesh ≤5 fallback)
`done` · P2 · L · dep: MEET-CORE-01 (vulos-relay) · parallel: yes — src/apps/spaces/, src/lib/call/
Scope: Replace the Spaces calling stack to use `livekit-client` (MIT) JS SDK for rooms >5 participants;
preserve the existing `fabric.js` mesh path for ≤5 (intimate calls, lower-latency, no SFU dependency).
Route selection at room join based on expected participant count + Pro-tier gate. UI: speaker grid,
active-speaker emphasis, raise-hand, breakout-room selector. Tokens fetched from vulos-cloud MEET-CP-01.
AC: [x] livekit-client wired for >5 [x] mesh fallback for ≤5 [x] speaker grid + active-speaker UI [x] tokens fetched from cloud [x] npm run build && npm test
Clarification (2026-06-15): LiveKit/SFU is NOT used in the current codebase. Calls are P2P WebRTC mesh
only (via @vulos/relay-client/call). Max 6 participants enforced in CallView.jsx; a clear "at capacity"
message is shown at ≥6 participants instead of silently failing. Recording is not yet available.

## Area: Relay-client adoption + Spaces UI polish (Wave C — 2026-05-24)

### [RELAY-CLIENT-02] Migrate office to consume @vulos/relay-client + delete local copies
`done` · P1 · M · dep: RELAY-CLIENT-01 (vulos-relay) · parallel: yes — package.json, src/lib/
Scope: After RELAY-CLIENT-01 ships the JS package at `vulos-relay/client/`, add
`"@vulos/relay-client": "file:../vulos-relay/client"` to office's package.json; replace local imports of
`src/lib/{endpoints,offlineBootstrap,signaling,fabric,presence,call,useLiveCursors,roundTripCheck}` with
`@vulos/relay-client/*` imports; DELETE the local source files. Verify nothing references the deleted paths
(`grep -r "src/lib/signaling\|src/lib/fabric\|src/lib/endpoints\|src/lib/offlineBootstrap"` returns empty).
Run full build+test to confirm byte-equivalent behavior.
AC: [x] file: dep added [x] 8 local files deleted [x] imports swapped [x] grep clean [x] npm run build + npm test green [x] cross-repo vulos npm run build green

### [MEET-FRONTEND-POLISH-01] Spaces UI polish — captions panel, recording UX, breakouts wired, responsive grid
`done` · P2 · M · dep: MEET-SPACES-01 · parallel: yes — src/apps/spaces/components/
Scope: MEET-SPACES-01 delivered the LiveKit calling surface + speaker grid + raise-hand + breakout stub +
recording toggle. Bring it to ship-ready:
(a) **Captions panel** — consume the vulos OS `MEET-TRANSCRIPT-01` SSE stream (`GET /api/meet/transcribe/stream/{room}`),
    scrolling transcript with speaker attribution; toggleable from meet chrome.
(b) **Recording indicator** — REC badge + remaining-quota-minutes countdown when active.
(c) **Raise-hand queue** — visible state change + queue position when multiple hands up; speaker UI dismiss.
(d) **Breakout rooms** — wire the stub: admin creates breakouts; drift users in/out; return-to-main.
(e) **Responsive speaker grid** — 1/2/4/9/16/25 tile layouts adapting to viewport.
(f) **Active-speaker emphasis** — subtle border-glow on the loudest tile.
AC: [x] captions panel renders SSE [x] recording indicator + quota [x] raise-hand queue [x] breakout create/drift/return [x] responsive grid (test viewports) [x] active-speaker animation [x] npm run build + npm test green

### [CONTACTS-CRUD] Individual contacts REST CRUD
`done` · P1 · S · dep: none · parallel: yes
Scope: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/contacts/:uid endpoints with account isolation, wired in main.go; ContactsApp.jsx uses REST as primary path when CardDAV not configured.
AC: [x] list/create/get/update/delete via REST [x] account isolation enforced [x] ContactsApp falls back to REST when VITE_CARDDAV_BASE unset [x] go build ./...

### [SHEETS-PASTE-VALUES] Sheets Cmd+Shift+V paste values only
`done` · P2 · S · dep: OFFICE-02 · parallel: yes
Scope: Real implementation of paste-values-only in KeyboardShortcuts.jsx: reads clipboard as plain text, parses TSV, strips formula prefix, injects cells via setCellValueInData.
AC: [x] Cmd+Shift+V pastes plain text values into cells [x] TSV multi-cell paste supported [x] formula prefix stripped

### [DEPLOY-STATIC] Tigris static deploy script
`done` · P2 · S · dep: none · parallel: yes
Scope: scripts/deploy-static.sh: builds each target, uploads to Tigris via AWS CLI, prints CDN URLs, --latest flag writes sha pointer. DEPLOY.md documents usage.
AC: [x] script builds + uploads all targets [x] --latest flag works [x] DEPLOY.md written [x] vite.config.*.js TODOs resolved
